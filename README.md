# Wavelet-EMD

The earth moverâ€™s distance (EMD) is an important perceptually meaningful metric for comparing histograms,
but it suffers from high (O(N3 logN)) computational complexity. We present a novel linear time algorithm for
approximating the EMD for low dimensional histograms using the sum of absolute values of the weighted wavelet
coefficients of the difference histogram.
